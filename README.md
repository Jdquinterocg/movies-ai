## Getting Started

This project focuses on creating a web application for movie search and querying using modern technologies such as Neo4j for graph database and OpenAI for generating complex queries based on natural language.

## Key Features
- Advanced Search: Enables users to search for movies by title, actors, categories, and other properties.
- Integration with Neo4j: Utilizes a graph database (Neo4j) to store and query relationships between movies, actors, categories, and awards.
- Artificial Intelligence: Implements OpenAI to generate Cypher queries based on user descriptions and questions.


## Technologies Used
Openai, nextjs and neo4j

## Database Setup

Node and relationship creation queries are documented in the database.txt file.
